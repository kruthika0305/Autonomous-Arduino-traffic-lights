# Autonomous-Arduino-traffic-lights
• Worked in a team of three members and successfully developed a working model of Arduino traffic lights with speed and vehicle detection features

•Used OpenCV with Python to detect and count vehicles, IR sensors to detect the speed

•Assembled the hardware components and sketched the Arduino Uno circuit layout on TinkerCAD in symbiosis with the code required to run the project

•This model can help in maintaining proper traffic management without any supervision
